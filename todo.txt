    making new child post of parent where parent has a sibling behaves unexpectedly. gonna be a nightmare
	make post times more specific if recently posted
	make replybox unsnap from attached post if scoll off screen
	maybe give replybox an X icon somehow if it's attached
backend
	avatar uploads
	everything
	figure out logins
    insert post needs to be parameterized. im a dumb
